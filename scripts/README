timeall is the script which runs all of the timelanguage scripts (where language is c, perl etc)
each of these timelanguage scripts is a loop which invoke the time1 script with appropriate parameters
#
# LANGUAGE=$1
# PREFIX=$2
# INDEX=$3
# COMMAND=$4
# SUFFIX=$5
#
we create an indexed data file, data.language.index
echo language/index to it
time command prefixindexsuffix and put the output and error into the file
then mark a trailing footer to the data file

each of these data files is stored in the output directory.

# perl -MCPAN -e 'install Linux::Proc::Cpuinfo'
cd scripts
PERL5LIB=. perl html_table.pl generates a HTML table of the data files called ../output/project_euler_timings_${hostname}.html
PERL5LIB=. perl plot_times.pl which uses gnuplot to create a file called ./project_euler.${hostname}.ps which shows the data files graphically
